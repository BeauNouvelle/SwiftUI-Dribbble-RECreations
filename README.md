# SwiftUI-RECreations

Here you can find the source code from my live streams.
[YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/getswifty)

I stream most days on both Twitch and YouTube, but the videos are archived on YouTube.
It may take some time before the links to the videos are updated here (esp if you're viewing this on the day)

I generally commit the code as I go on stream, so you can jump in here while it's all happened and take a look for yourself.
I hope you find some of this content useful and can use it in your own apps!

##### Please don't open pull requests with changes to the code!
At least not yet. The purpose is to keep this code AS IS so it matches what you see in the video uploads.

If there's a HUGE mistake and it hurts you to look at it, and it MUST be fixed.... create a PR but make sure the project with your fixes are in a copied folder of the original project with a suffix of "-fixed", and update the readme to ALSO link to this fixed folder.
All further PRs should be made on that same "-fixed" folder.
